 * Define standard data adapters used to retrieve data (usually from REST APIs)
 *
 * ## Adapters are responsible for retrieving data
 * In LocusZoom, the act of fetching data (from API, JSON file, or Tabix) is separate from the act of rendering data.
 * Adapters are used to handle retrieving from different sources, and can provide various advanced functionality such
 *  as caching, data harmonization, and annotating API responses with calculated fields. They can also be used to join
 *  two data sources, such as annotating association summary statistics with LD information.
 *
 * Most of LocusZoom's builtin layouts and adapters are written for the field names and data formats of the
 *  UMich [PortalDev API](https://portaldev.sph.umich.edu/docs/api/v1/#introduction):
 *  if your data is in a different format, an adapter can be used to coerce or rename fields.
 *  Although it is possible to change every part of a rendering layout to expect different fields, this is often much
 *  more work than providing data in the expected format.
 *
 * ## Creating data adapters
 * The documentation in this section describes the available data types and adapters. Real LocusZoom usage almost never
 *  creates these classes directly: rather, they are defined from configuration objects that ask for a source by name.
 *
 * The below example creates an object responsible for fetching two different GWAS summary statistics datasets from two different API endpoints, for any data
 *  layer that asks for fields from `trait1:fieldname` or `trait2:fieldname`.
 *
 *  ```
 *  const data_sources = new LocusZoom.DataSources();
 *  data_sources.add("trait1", ["AssociationLZ", {url: "http://server.com/api/single/", params: {source: 1}}]);
 *  data_sources.add("trait2", ["AssociationLZ", {url: "http://server.com/api/single/", params: {source: 2}}]);
 *  ```
 *
 *  These data sources are then passed to the plot when data is to be rendered:
 *  `const plot = LocusZoom.populate("#lz-plot", data_sources, layout);`
 *
 * @module LocusZoom_Adapters
